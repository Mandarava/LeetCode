##019.Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,
<pre><code>Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.<br/>
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.</code></pre>
Note:
Given n will always be valid.</br>
Try to do this in one pass.
